## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### My favorite applications
    1. Google Map:
        - Real-time traffic updates and alternate route suggestions
        - Real-time speed tracking and arrival time estimation
    2. TikTok:
        - Endless scrolling UX that keeps users engaged
        - Easy-to-use editing tools for content creation
        - Recommendation system sending content you might be interested in
    3. Zoom:
        - Screen sharing and virtual whiteboard tools
        - Breakout rooms for small-group discussions
    4. WeChat:
        - Seamless integration of messaging, social media (Moments), and payments in one app
        - Mini Programs offer app-like experiences without leaving the platform
        - Allowing fast, secure payments and transfers
        
### An app idea 
 Iâ€™d like to build an app called "LocalLoop", which helps people discover community events, local deals, and nearby meetups based on their interests and location. Users can set preferences like hobbies, food, fitness, or tech, and the app curates a personalized feed of events such as workshops, markets, hikes, or pop-up sales. Event organizers and small businesses can also post directly through the app. Key features include interactive maps, RSVP/reminder options, and chat groups for attendees. The goal is to strengthen local connections and make it easier for people to explore what's happening around them and find new friends with similar interests.

## Notes

Navigating Xcode for the first time was a bit challenging. Understanding where to find the storyboard, how to switch between view and code files, and how to use the Inspector panels took some trial and error.
